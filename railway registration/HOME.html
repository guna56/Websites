                           <h1>How to book train ticket</h1>
                           <p>It is extremely easy to book train tickets on IRCTC. 

                            Below, we are mentioning the steps that you can follow to make your bookings quickly.<br>
                    
                             Step 1: Choose the source of your journey and the destination to get your train tickets 
                             book. Select the date on which you wish to start the journey <br>
                    
                             Step 2: Now, you will have a list of trains based on your destination and source. You have 
                             to choose the one you want to book tickets for. <br>
                    
                             Step 3: Filter and select the seat class. You can choose from a wide variety of options 
                             such as sleeper, seater, first-class AC, second-class AC and third-class AC.<br> 
                    
                              Step 4: Select your boarding point. Enter the berth preferences and passenger details. 
                              There can be multiple passengers, and you will have to enter the details of each person 
                              separately. <br>
                    
                             Step 5: Enter the necessary contact details including email and mobile number as your 
                              e-ticket and m-ticket will be sent on the registered information. <br>
                    
                             Step 6: Select the additional preferences. For example, you can make your bookings only 
                             if the seats are available or you can specifically book the lower berth or window seat. <br>
                    
                              Step 7: Once you have filled all the above-stated details, choose the payment mode that 
                             is most convenient for you. You can choose from a wide range of options such as debit card,
                              credit card, net banking and UPI payments.<br> 
                    
                             Step 8: Enter the User ID and password of your IRCTC accounts. You will soon be redirected
                              to the final page, and your tickets will be confirmed. Soon, you will receive your ticket
                             on your email ID and mobile. <br>
                    
                             As you can see, the process is immensely easy, and itâ€™s much better than spending hours
                             just waiting in front of the railway ticket counter for your turn. Besides that, when you 
                             book train tickets online, services such as PNR enquiry and live status tracking are easily
                             accessible. If you are using GoIbibo for ticket booking, the procedure is pretty much the 
                             same. You will notice that having a valid IRCTC account is mandatory for you to be 
                             eligible for making your railway ticket booking on GoIbibo</p>
